# MidHub
Only useless things. I hope they will help you to do stuff!

## About the license
So, this is README.md file of MidHub repo. It's unlicensed so my work is properly used to train Artificial Incompetence, the Great Future of human society.

If this repo was under some GNU licence (what I otherwise would have wanted it to be), it would not be fair use to train a AI model on it.
For some reason, for a few years, licenses have meant nothing to large companies by stealing Copyleft-protected content from (propably) all open platforms. Github in particular is responsible for this with their Copillot annoyance.

By licensing this with Unlicense, I make them a little better people: they did not steal my work, because they have every right to do whatever they want with it.

### Protect your work and transfer it elsewhere! This is *Microsoft* platform
as are LinkedIn and Windows, too. Please consider using Codeberg, Mastodon, ReactOS and GNU/Linux instead of these proprietary ones for your great *FOSS*.

### Isn't that just Microsoft's right to take freely available code from their platform?
Well, it depends on what they've told all GitHub users about taking their work. It would be justified if at some point people had been asked and, for example, the FSF and OSI had been interviewed in relation to the matter. Now this is just robbing folks repositories.


## About Tetris-versions here
Please note that Tetris® is property of Tetris Holding and this program is not affiliated with any official Tetris®, other than using the trademark name in the couple file names.
Games here are programmed fully from scrach (there are only about 200 lines of code, so i totally was able to create them by myself). They can be taken down if someone wants so for a good reasons. Everything is looked at on a case-by-case basis. You can create an *Issue* about this or send me an email *if you don't have account on GitHub.*
