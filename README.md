# MidHub
Only useless things. I hope they will help you to do stuff!

### About the license
So, this is README.md file of MidHub repo. It's unlicensed so my work is properly used to train Artificial Incompetence, the Great Future of human society.

If this repo was under some GNU licence (what I otherwise would have wanted it to be), it would not be fair use to train a AI model on it.
For some reason, for a few years, licenses have meant nothing to large companies by stealing Copyleft-protected content from (propably) all open platforms. Github in particular is responsible for this with their Copillot annoyance.

By licensing this with Unlicense, I make them a little better people: they did not steal my work, because they have every right to do whatever they want.

### Protect your work and transfer it elsewhere! This is *Microsoft* platform
as are LinkedIn and Windows, too. Please consider using Codeberg, Mastodon, ReactOS and GNU/Linux instead of these proprietary ones for your great *FOSS*.
